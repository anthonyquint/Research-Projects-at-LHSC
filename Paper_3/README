Welcome! 

This folder contains the current work for Paper 3: 
- Risk of Major Bleeding with Ibrutinib in Patients with Thrombocytopenia â€“ a Retrospective Single-Center Canadian Study.

In summary, this paper seeks to assess the possible risk factors of major bleeding in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, who are taking the drug: 
ibruntinib. This is relevant because ibruntinib itself may induce a higher risk of bleeeding. The complete motivation for this study can be read in the file: 
"Ibrutinib and bleeding REB protocol, Nov 15,2020 clean version.docx". 

A brief outline of the statistical analysis that was planned to be performed can be found in the methods file: "Methods_Ibrutinib_and_bleeding_AQ_June_22  - TD & 
MD Edits". During the process of analyzing the data, more ideas and considerations were implemented in the data analysis than is described in the methods file. 
The overall analysis that was conducted, and the results, is reflected in the results file: "Results_Ibrutinib_and_bleeding_AQ_Aug_2". The results file is the most
complete summary of the work that was completed. 




In this study, the dependent (outcome) variabale is 
- bleeding outcome (Major, Minor, or None), 
and the independent variables are: 
- Platelet count, Hemoglobin concentration, molecular cytogenetics, prior lines of therapy, anticoagulation, antiplatelets, and 
Past medical history (PMHx) bleeding risk.
