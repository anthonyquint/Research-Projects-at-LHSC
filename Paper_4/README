In summary, this paper seeks to assess the potential for the drug Rivaroxaban to improve thromboembolism outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma,  
on Lenalidomide-based therapy (type of chemotherapy).The complete motivation for this study can be read in the file: 
"RithMM new open label protocol -2018 final_V.doc". 

As is described in the document: "RithMM new open label protocol -2018 final_V.doc", this project is in it's preliminary stages, and is proving it's feasibility
to be a valuable and plausible clinical trial. Therefore, the analysis completed so far is on a limited dataset, and primariliy offers some simple descriptive 
statistics on pertinent physiological values. The file: "Results_RithMM_Study_Aug2" summarizes the raw data, and implements the results into two tables (last
pages of the docs). 

Since the primary structure of the clinical trail is to evaluate how treatment type (aspiring vs. Rivaroxaban) affects a patient over the course of time (3 
follow-up appoitments), a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (mixed), is a suitable form of statistical analysis. The between measures variables will be the drug 
they are taking (aspiring vs. Rivaroxaban). The within measures variable will be the 3 times the patient is checked during follow-up appointments.
I assessed how the treatment (drug) type and time influence certain scores, such as LDH concentration, etc in the R jupyter notebook:
"TwoWay_Repeated_Measures_ANOVA_R.ipynb". From the scores I did evaluate, I found no significnat results. However, this result was expected given the limited 
dataset. Furthermore, the dataset was also incomplete, in that many patients had missing data point, which further reduced the sample size. These factors 
contributed the decision to leave the ANOVA analysis out of the final results docs and out of the submitted abstract.
