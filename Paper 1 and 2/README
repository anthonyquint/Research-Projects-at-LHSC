The goal of this study is to assess how various maintenance strategies, post-autologous stem cell transplantation, in high and low risk patients, function to 
improve survival. The complete motivation for this study can be read in the file: "Protocol- Final clean version March17,2021.docx". 

A brief outline of the statistical analysis that was planned to be performed can be found in the methods file: "Methods_MMproject_May21st_AQ". 
During the process of analyzing the data, more ideas and considerations were implemented in the data analysis than is described in the methods 
file. The overall analysis that was conducted, and the results, is reflected in the results file: "UpdatedResults_MMproject_July27". The results file 
is the most complete summary of the work that was completed, and can be used as a guiding tool to explain why the code was written as it was.
