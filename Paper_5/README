Note: the excel and csv files containing the data for the study are not included due to confidentiality reasons. 

In summary, this paper seeks to assess the serologic responses to vaccine for COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies (for example, cancers). 
The complete motivation for this study can be read in the file: "Research Plan_V8_05Jul2021.docx". 

This project is still currently in the data collection stages, therefore there are no results to discuss. The current plan of data analysis is described in
the docs: "Methods_COV19Vacc_Study". This methods design will most likely change once all the data is attained.
