# Research-Projects-at-LHSC
I began working at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) starting May 2021, under the subdivision of Hematology. I am participating in a few clinical research groups
at the hospital where I am responsible for completing the data analysis and statistics. The projects I am working on are:

2. Outcomes of Maintenance Treatment Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients: A Canadian Single Center Experience.
